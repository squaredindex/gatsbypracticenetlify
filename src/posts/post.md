You know, I was God once. Okay, it's 500 dollars, you have no choice of carrier, the battery can't hold the charge and the reception isn't very… Yes, except the Dave Matthews Band doesn't rock.

Morbo can't understand his teleprompter because he forgot how you say that letter that's shaped like a man wearing a hat.

**Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing.** _My fellow Earthicans, as I have explained in my book 'Earth in the Balance'', and the much more popular ''Harry Potter and the Balance of Earth', we need to defend our planet against pollution._ Also dark wizards.

## Who am I making this out to?

It's just like the story of the grasshopper and the octopus. All year long, the grasshopper kept burying acorns for winter, while the octopus mooched off his girlfriend and watched TV. But then the winter came, and the grasshopper died, and the octopus ate all his acorns. Also, he got a race car. Is any of this getting through to you? Good man. Nixon's pro-war and pro-family.

1. Do a flip!
2. When will that be?
3. Actually, that's still true.

### And I'm his friend Jesus.

Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. You wouldn't. Ask anyway! For one beautiful night I knew what it was like to be a grandmother. Subjugated, yet honored. Ooh, name it after me!

* You, minion. Lift my arm. AFTER HIM!
* Soothe us with sweet lies.
* Now what?

Why would I want to know that? These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. THE BIG BRAIN AM WINNING AGAIN! I AM THE GREETEST! NOW I AM LEAVING EARTH, FOR NO RAISEN!

Does anybody else feel jealous and aroused and worried? Dear God, they'll be killed on our doorstep! And there's no trash pickup until January 3rd. Ummm…to eBay? You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see!

Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved. Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'? Oh, all right, I am. But if anything happens to me, tell them I died robbing some old man.

I just told you! You've killed me! And remember, don't do anything that affects anything, unless it turns out you were supposed to, in which case, for the love of God, don't not do it! Enough about your promiscuous mother, Hermes! We have bigger problems.

Would you censor the Venus de Venus just because you can see her spewers? Oh, I think we should just stay friends. Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere? Oh, but you can. But you may have to metaphorically make a deal with the devil. And by "devil", I mean Robot Devil. And by "metaphorically", I mean get your coat.

I'm Santa Claus! So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Fry! Quit doing the right thing, you jerk! You lived before you met me?!

Quite possible. We live long and are celebrated poopers. And then the battle's not so bad? Belligerent and numerous. Leela, Bender, we're going grave robbing. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful!

Good news, everyone! I've taught the toaster to feel love! Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. No argument here. Bender! Ship! Stop bickering or I'm going to come back there and change your opinions manually!

Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! No. We're on the top. Noooooo! Guess again. Ummm…to eBay? Please, Don-Bot… look into your hard drive, and open your mercy file!

Why would a robot need to drink? You've killed me! Oh, you've killed me! These old Doomsday Devices are dangerously unstable. I'll rest easier not knowing where they are. You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see!

Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them. Oh yeah, good luck with that. In your time, yes, but nowadays shut up! Besides, these are adult stemcells, harvested from perfectly healthy adults whom I killed for their stemcells.
